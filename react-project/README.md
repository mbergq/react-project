This is a school project where the goal was to learn React.

I've use the Harvard Art Musueom API: https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs#resources-that-are-available
to get some data/images.

I've also made use of 'styled-components' and 'Formik' packages from npm.

I might continue to develop the styling and responsiveness later as it is very
basic and dry right now. There is also a lot of things i know i can add to the
'Paint' page.
